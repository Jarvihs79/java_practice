 * ðŸ“Œ Reference Data Types in Java
 * Reference data types store memory addresses instead of actual values. These
 * references point to objects stored in heap memory, while the reference
 * variables themselves are stored in stack memory.
 * 
 * This distinction is important because:
 * âœ” Objects are accessed indirectly through references.
 * âœ” Multiple references can point to the same object.
 * âœ” Changes made through one reference affect all references pointing to that
 * object.
