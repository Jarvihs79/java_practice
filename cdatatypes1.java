    // all non primitive datatypes.

    // before nnon primiitive datatypes i want to learn what is object in java.
    // An object in Java is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity that
    // has state (data/attributes) and behavior (methods/functions).

    /*
     * ðŸ”¥ Key Points About Objects
     * âœ” Objects are instances of a class.
     * âœ” Each object has its own copy of instance variables.
     * âœ” Multiple objects of a class can exist independently.
     * âœ” Objects are stored in heap memory.
     * âœ” Objects are referenced using variables (Car myCar).
     */

    /*
     * âœ… Real-Life Analogy
     * Think of a class as a blueprint for a house, and an object as an actual house
     * built from that blueprint.
     * You can create multiple houses (objects) from the same blueprint (class),
     * but each house can have different features (attributes).
     */

    /*
     * ðŸ”¹ How is an Object Created in Java?
     * Objects are created using the new keyword.
     * "ClassName objectName = new ClassName();"
     */
